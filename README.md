I worked as a senior full-stack developer and was experienced in all stages of the development cycle for various types of web services and projects.
I have extensive experience working both alone and as part of a team on often time-sensitive, challenging web development projects that require outstanding creative and technical capabilities and the ability to ensure all work is optimized across a wide range of platforms.
Very familiar with PHP, and Python but I have enjoyed working with modern JavaScript/TypeScript frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue for the front end and NodeJS, ExpressJS, NestJS, and HapiJS for the backend.
Always focused on producing well-documented, well-architectured, well-designed projects based on efficient and clean code.

My tech stacks:
JavaScript/TypeScript: React(Next, Gatsby, React Native, Redux, Hook, Saga), Angular(RxJS, JS/2+), Vue(Nuxt, Vuex, Vuetify), jQuery, D3.js, three.js, NodeJS, ExpressJS, NestJS(MikroORM), HapiJS
UI/UX: HTML/CSS, HTML5/CSS3, SCSS/SASS/LESS, Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap 3/4, Material UI, Antd
Mobile: React Native - CLI & Expo, Swift, Java, Kotlin, Xcode(Storyboard/AutoLayout/SwiftUI), Android Studio
PHP: Laravel, CodeIgniter, Symfony
Python: Django, Flask
Git: Github, Gitlab, BitBucket
CMS/eCommerce: Wordpress, Shopify, Zoho
Database: MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server
Cloud Serer: AWS(S3, EC2, Lambda), Azure, Firebase, Docker
Development Tool: CI/CD Pipeline(Jenkins), Testing Library(Jest, Mocha), Webpack(Babel)
API: REST, GraphQL(Apollo, Helix, AWS Amplify)

From my expertise experience, I can provide the perfect solutions and creative ideas.
Looking forward to discussing your project and business.

Thanks!
